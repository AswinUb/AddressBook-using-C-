# AddressBook
 The Address Book project is a simple C program that allows users to store, manage, and retrieve contact information. It enables users to add, search, update, and delete contact details, including Name, Phone Number, and Email. The contact details are stored in a file (CSV or text format) to ensure data persistence even after the program is closed.
